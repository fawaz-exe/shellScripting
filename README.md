Shell Scripting in Bash

1_HelloWorld.sh

#! => schbang
#! /bin/bash -> Shell we want to work with

Before every shell script we have to write the above command

2_Variables_Comments.sh

# => Comments

There are two types of variables
1. System Variables
2. User Variables

1. System Variables
    Linux & Unix pre-defined variables
    These are the variables in capital cases
    Use $ before the name of the variable

2. User Defined Variables
    These are defined by the user
    The variable name should not be starting with a number
